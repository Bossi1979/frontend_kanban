        <h2 id="m2427">Relevant Legal Bases</h2>
        <p><strong>Relevant legal bases according to the GDPR:</strong> Below you will find an overview of the legal
            bases of
            the GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR,
            national
            data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. Furthermore, if more
            specific
            legal bases are applicable in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given consent to the
                processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance of a contract and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. b)
                    GDPR)</strong> -
                Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order
                to take
                steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for
                the
                purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such
                interests
                are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require
                protection
                of personal data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany:</strong> In addition to the data protection
            regulations of
            the GDPR, national data protection regulations apply in Germany. This includes in particular the Federal
            Data
            Protection Act (BDSG). The BDSG contains in particular special regulations on the right to information, the
            right to
            erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other
            purposes,
            and transmission as well as automated decision-making in individual cases including profiling. Furthermore,
            it
            regulates data processing for the purposes of the employment relationship (Section 26 BDSG), in particular
            with
            regard to the establishment, implementation, or termination of employment relationships and the consent of
            employees. Furthermore, data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.</p>
        <h2 id="m27">Security Measures</h2>
        <p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking
            into
            account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of
            processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural
            persons, in
            order to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.</p>
        <p>The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by
            controlling physical access to the data, as well as access, input, transmission, security of availability,
            and their
            separation. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure that data subjects' rights are respected,
            data is
            erased, and responses to data subject requests are provided. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal
            data
            into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software, and processes, in accordance
            with the
            principle of data protection through technology design and data protection-friendly default settings.</p>
        <h2 id="m25">Transmission of Personal Data</h2>
        <p>Personal data is transmitted to third countries outside the EU or the EEA (so-called third countries) only if
            it is
            necessary for the performance of a contract, required by law, if you have given us your consent or within
            the scope
            of order processing.</p>
        <h2 id="m24">International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area
            (EEA), or
            the Swiss Confederation) or if this is done in the context of using the services of third parties or
            disclosure or
            transfer of data to third parties, this only occurs if it is necessary to fulfill our (pre)contractual
            obligations,
            on the basis of your consent, on the basis of a legal obligation or on the basis of our legitimate
            interests.
            Subject to legal or contractual permissions, we process or have the data processed in a third country only
            if the
            special requirements of Art. 44 ff. of the GDPR are met. This means, for example, processing is carried out
            on the
            basis of special guarantees, such as the officially recognized determination of a data protection level
            corresponding to the EU (e.g., for the USA through the "Privacy Shield") or compliance with officially
            recognized
            special contractual obligations (so-called "standard contractual clauses").</p>
        <h2 id="m10">Rights of Data Subjects</h2>
        <p>You have the right to request confirmation as to whether the data in question will be processed and to be
            informed of
            this data and to receive further information and a copy of the data in accordance with legal requirements.
        </p>
        <p>You have the right, in accordance with the legal requirements, to request the completion of the data
            concerning you
            or the rectification of the incorrect data concerning you.</p>
        <p>In accordance with legal requirements, you have the right to demand that the relevant data be erased
            immediately or,
            alternatively, to demand a restriction of the processing of the data in accordance with legal requirements.
        </p>
        <p>You have the right to request that the data concerning you that you have provided to us be received in
            accordance
            with legal requirements and to request its transmission to other controllers.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, you have the right to file a complaint with the competent supervisory authority in accordance
            with legal
            requirements.</p>
        <h2 id="m134">Use of Cookies</h2>
        <p>We use temporary and permanent cookies, i.e., small files that are stored on the user's devices (explained in
            detail
            in the overview of the processing activities).</p>
        <p>The use of cookies is for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provision of the online offer and user-friendliness.</li>
            <li>Measurement of reach and analysis of the usage of our website.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="m225">Provision of the Online Offer and Web Hosting</h2>
        <p>In order to provide our online services securely and efficiently, we use the services of one or more web
            hosting
            providers from whose servers (or servers managed by them) the online services can be accessed. For these
            purposes,
            we may use infrastructure and platform services, computing capacity, storage space, and database services,
            as well
            as security and technical maintenance services.</p>
        <p>The data processed in the context of the provision of the hosting services may include all information
            relating to
            the users of our online offer that is collected in the course of use and communication. This regularly
            includes the
            IP address, which is necessary to be able to deliver the contents of online offers to browsers, and all
            entries made
            within our online offer or from websites.</p>
        <p><strong>Collection of access data and log files</strong>: We ourselves (or our web hosting provider) collect
            data on
            every access to the server (so-called server log files). The server log files may include the address and
            name of
            the web pages and files accessed, the date and time of access, data volumes transferred, notification of
            successful
            access, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page),
            IP
            address, and the requesting provider.</p>
        <p>The server log files can be used for security purposes, e.g., to avoid overloading the servers (especially in
            the
            case of abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks) and for troubleshooting.</p>
        <h2 id="m367">Registration, Login, and User Account</h2>
        <p>Users can create a user account. As part of the registration process, the necessary mandatory information is
            communicated to the users and processed for the purpose of providing the user account based on contractual
            performance obligations. The processed data includes, in particular, the login information (name, password,
            and an
            email address).</p>
        <p>During the registration and subsequent logins and use of our online services, we store the IP address and the
            time of
            the respective user action. The storage is based on our legitimate interests, as well as the user's
            protection
            against misuse and other unauthorized use. This data is generally not passed on to third parties unless it
            is
            necessary to pursue our claims or there is a legal obligation to do so.</p>
        <h2 id="m328">Plugins and Embedded Functions as well as Content</h2>
        <p>We integrate functional and content elements into our online offer that are obtained from the servers of
            their
            respective providers (hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers"). These may be, for example,
            graphics,
            videos, or social media buttons as well as contributions (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "Content").
        </p>
        <p>The integration always presupposes that the third-party providers of this content perceive the IP address of
            the
            users, as without the IP address they would not be able to send the content to their browsers. The IP
            address is
            therefore required for the display of this content or functions. We make every effort to use only those
            contents
            whose respective providers use the IP address solely for the delivery of the contents. Third-party providers
            may
            also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing
            purposes. Pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this
            website. The
            pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may contain technical
            information
            about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visiting time, and other information about the
            use of
            our online services, as well as being linked to such information from other sources.</p>
        <h2 id="m246">Business Analysis and Market Research</h2>
        <p>In order to operate our business economically, to recognize market trends, wishes of contractual partners and
            users,
            we analyze the data available to us on business transactions, contracts, inquiries, etc. We process
            inventory data,
            communication data, contract data, payment data, usage data, metadata based on the nature of the contractual
            relationships, and fulfill contractual obligations. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Business evaluations with the aim of recognizing users, trends, and wishes of contractual partners; we
                may
                process the data entered in the contracts, time of order, amount of orders, contract data, and contact
                data in
                order to recognize which services or products should be offered. The evaluations serve us alone and are
                not
                disclosed externally unless they are anonymous evaluations with summarized values.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="m357">Participation in Affiliate Partner Programs</h2>
        <p>Within our online offer, we use affiliate links, i.e., links to external websites of third parties, which are
            also
            called affiliate or referral links. If users follow links to other providers, take advantage of services or
            conclude
            contracts with the providers after clicking on the affiliate link, we receive a commission or other benefits
            from
            the provider (referred to as "affiliate commission" or "affiliate revenue").</p>
        <p>To sum it up, it is necessary for our online offer that we can track whether users who are interested in
            affiliate
            links and/or the offers available from us subsequently perceive the offers at the instigation of the
            affiliate links
            or our platform. For this purpose, the affiliate links and our offers are supplemented by certain values
            that can be
            part of the link or otherwise, e.g., in a cookie. These values include, in particular, the initial website
            (referrer), time, an online identifier of the operator of the website on which the affiliate link was
            located, an
            online identifier of the respective offer, the type of link, and the time of the website. The online
            identifiers are
            pseudonymous values. This means that the online identifiers themselves do not contain any personal data such
            as
            names or email addresses. They only help us to determine whether the same user who clicked on an affiliate
            link or
            was interested in an offer via our online offer has accepted the offer, i.e., has concluded a contract with
            the
            provider, for example. However, the online identifier is personal data insofar as it enables processing of
            personal
            data. The following information is also stored: IP address, browser and operating system used.</p>
        <p>The processing takes place on the basis of our legitimate interests, i.e., interest in the economic operation
            of our
            online offer, in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR.</p>
        <h2 id="m241">Google Analytics</h2>
        <p>On the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e., interest in the analysis, optimization, and economic
            operation of our
            online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. of the GDPR), we use Google Analytics, a web
            analysis
            service provided by Google LLC ("Google"). Google uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie
            about the
            use of the online offer by users is generally transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.
        </p>
        <p>Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus offers a guarantee of compliance with
            European data
            protection law (<a

        </p>
        <p>Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of our online offer by users, to compile
            reports
            on the activities within this online offer, and to provide us with further services associated with the use
            of this
            online offer and the use of the internet. Pseudonymous user profiles can be created from the processed data.
        </p>
        <p>We only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymization. This means that the IP address of the user is
            shortened
            by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the
            European
            Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transmitted to a Google server in the USA
            and
            shortened there.</p>
        <p>The IP address transmitted by the user's browser is not merged with other Google data. Users can prevent the
            storage
            of cookies by setting their browser software accordingly; users can also prevent Google from collecting the
            data
            generated by the cookie and relating to their use of the online offer and the processing of this data by
            Google by

        </p>
        <h2 id="m274">Google Universal Analytics</h2>
        <p>We use Google Analytics in the design as "Google Universal Analytics." "Universal Analytics" refers to a
            Google
            Analytics process in which user analysis is performed on the basis of a pseudonymous user ID and thus a
            pseudonymous
            profile of the user is created with information from the use of various devices (so-called "cross-device
            tracking").
        </p>
        <h2 id="m284">Jetpack (WordPress Stats)</h2>
        <p>We use the WordPress plugin Jetpack (here the sub-function "WordPress Stats"), which includes a tool for
            statistical
            evaluation of visitor access and is operated by Automattic Inc., 60 29th Street #343, San Francisco, CA

            Jetpack uses cookies stored on users' devices for the purpose of analyzing the use of our online offer by
            users.
            Among other things, Jetpack can recognize whether and when a subpage of our online offer was opened by a
            user and
            which links were clicked by the user, and then provide us with information about this to optimize our online
            offer.
            Jetpack is also used to show users personalized advertisements, as well as related offers and
            recommendations, based

        <h2 id="m274">Facebook Pixel, Custom Audiences, and Facebook Conversion</h2>
        <p>Within our online offer, due to our legitimate interests in the analysis, optimization, and economic
            operation of our
            online offer and for these purposes, the so-called "Facebook pixel" of the social network Facebook, which is
            operated by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA, or if you are resident in the EU,
            Facebook
            Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbor, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Facebook").</p>
        <p>Facebook is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus offers a guarantee of compliance with
            European data
            protection law (<a
                href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&amp;status=Active">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&amp;status=Active</a>).
        </p>
        <p>With the help of the Facebook pixel, Facebook is on the one hand able to determine the visitors of our online
            offer
            as a target group for the presentation of ads (so-called "Facebook ads"). Accordingly, we use the Facebook
            pixel to
            display the Facebook ads placed by us only to Facebook users who have also shown an interest in our online
            offer or
            who have certain characteristics (e.g., interests in certain topics or products that are determined on the
            basis of
            the websites visited) that we transmit to Facebook (so-called "custom audiences"). With the help of the
            Facebook
            pixel, we also want to ensure that our Facebook ads correspond to the potential interest of users and do not
            have a
            harassing effect. With the help of the Facebook pixel, we can also track the effectiveness of Facebook ads
            for
            statistical and market research purposes by seeing whether users were redirected to our website after
            clicking on a
            Facebook ad (so-called "conversion").</p>
        <p>The processing of the data by Facebook takes place within the framework of Facebook's data usage policy.
            Accordingly,
            general information on the display of Facebook ads, in Facebook's data usage policy: <a
                href="https://www.facebook.com/policy.php">https://www.facebook.com/policy.php</a>. Specific information
            and

        </p>
        <p>You can object to the collection by the Facebook pixel and the use of your data to display Facebook ads. To
            set which
            types of ads are displayed to you within Facebook, you can go to the page set up by Facebook and follow the
            instructions there on the settings for usage-based advertising: <a

            cookies are set by Google AdSense within the scope of Google's advertising network DoubleClick. The

            generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA
            and
            stored there. Google may transfer this information to third parties if this is required by law or if third

        <h2 id="m217">Google AdWords and conversion measurement</h2>
        <p>This website uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising program of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater
            Parkway,
            Mountain View, CA 94043, United States ("Google").</p>
        <p>As part of Google AdWords, we use so-called conversion tracking. When you click on an ad served by Google, a
            conversion tracking cookie is set. Cookies are small text files that the Internet browser places on the
            user's
            computer. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are not used for personal identification of
            the user.
            If the user visits certain pages of this website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and we can
            recognize
            that the user clicked on the ad and was redirected to this page.</p>
        <p>Each Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. The cookies cannot be tracked through the websites
            of
            AdWords customers. The information collected through the conversion cookie is used to compile conversion
            statistics
            for AdWords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. Customers are told the total number of users
            who
            clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page tagged with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do
            not
            receive information that personally identifies users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you can
            opt-out
            of this use by slightly disabling the Google Conversion Tracking cookie on your web browser under User
            Preferences.
            You will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.</p>
        <p>The storage of "conversion cookies" is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a
            legitimate
            interest in analyzing user behavior in order to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>

            website, the login status, a shopping cart, or the location where a video was viewed. The term "cookies"
            also includes other technologies that perform the same functions as cookies (e.g., if user information is
            stored using pseudonymous online identifiers, also referred to as "user IDs").</p>
        <p>The following types and functions of cookies are distinguished:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Temporary cookies (also: session cookies):</strong> Temporary cookies are deleted at the latest
                after a user has left an online service and closed his browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Permanent cookies:</strong> Permanent cookies remain stored even after closing the browser. For
                example, the login status can be saved or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user
                visits a website again. The interests of users who are used for range measurement or marketing purposes
                can also be stored in such a cookie.</li>
            <li><strong>First-party cookies:</strong> First-party cookies are set by ourselves.</li>
            <li><strong>Third-party cookies:</strong> Third-party cookies are mainly used by advertisers (so-called
                third parties) to process user information.</li>
            <li><strong>Required cookies (also: essential cookies):</strong> Cookies can be required for the operation
                of a website (e.g., to save logins or other user inputs or for security reasons).</li>
            <li><strong>Statistical, marketing, and personalization cookies:</strong> Cookies are also generally used in
                the context of range measurement and when a user's interests or behavior (e.g., viewing certain content,
                using functions, etc.) on individual websites are stored in a user profile. Such profiles are used, for
                example, to display content to users that corresponds to their potential interests. This process is also
                referred to as "tracking," i.e., tracking the potential interests of users. If we use cookies or
                "tracking" technologies, we will inform you separately in our privacy policy or when obtaining consent.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Information about legal bases: The legal basis on which we process your personal data with the help of
            cookies depends on whether we ask you for your consent. If this applies and you consent to the use of
            cookies, the legal basis for processing your data is your declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed
            with the help of cookies will be processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g., in a business
            operation of our online service and its improvement) or, if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our
            contractual obligations.</p>
        <p>General information on revocation and objection (opt-out): Depending on whether the processing is based on
            consent or legal permission, you have the option at any time to revoke any consent you have given or to
            object to the processing of your data by cookie technologies (collectively referred to as "opt-out"). You
            can initially declare your objection by means of your browser settings, e.g., by deactivating the use of
            cookies (although this may also restrict the functionality of our online service). An objection to the use
            of cookies for online marketing purposes can be declared for a large number of services, especially in the
            case of tracking, via the websites <a
                href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>
            and <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a>. In addition, you can
            receive further instructions on how to object in the context of the information on the service providers and
            cookies used.</p>
        <p>Processing of cookie data based on consent: Before we process or have data processed within the framework of
            the use of cookies, we ask users for their consent, which can be revoked at any time. Before consent has not
            been given, cookies are used if they are necessary for the operation of our online service. Their use is
            based on our interest and the interest of the users in the expected functionality of our online service.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Processed data types: Usage data (e.g., websites visited, interest in content, access times),
                meta/communication data (e.g., device information, IP addresses).</li>
            <li>Persons affected: Users (e.g., website visitors, users of online services).</li>
            <li>Purposes of processing: Range measurement (e.g., access statistics, recognition of returning visitors),
                tracking (e.g., interest/behavioral profiling, use of cookies), visitor action evaluation, profiling
                (creation of user profiles), remarketing, interest-based and behavioral marketing, profiling (creation
                of user profiles with pseudonyms), conversion measurement (measurement of the effectiveness of marketing
                activities), interest-based and behavioral marketing, profiling (creation of user profiles).</li>
            <li>Legal basis: Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a GDPR), Legitimate Interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f
                GDPR).</li>

            protection declaration as soon as changes in the data processing carried out by us make this necessary. We
            will inform you as soon as the changes require your cooperation (e.g., consent) or other individual
            notification.</p>
        <p>If we provide addresses and contact information of companies and organizations in this privacy policy, please
            note that the addresses may change over time and please check the information before contacting us.</p>
        <h2 id="m248">Rights of Data Subjects</h2>
        <p>As a data subject, you have the right to exercise your rights under the GDPR with respect to the processing
            of your personal data by us.</p>
        <p>In particular, you have the following rights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have the right to obtain confirmation from us as to whether or not personal data concerning you is
                being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and the following information:
                the purposes of the processing; the categories of personal data concerned; the recipients or categories
                of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed; the envisaged period for which
                the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period; the
                existence of the right to request from us rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of
                processing of personal data concerning you or to object to such processing; the right to lodge a
                complaint with a supervisory authority; where the personal data are not collected from you, any
                available information as to their source; the existence of automated decision-making, including
                profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) GDPR and, at least in those cases, meaningful
                information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such
                processing for you. Where personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international
                organization, you have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46
                GDPR relating to the transfer.</li>
            <li>You have the right to obtain from us without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data
                concerning you. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, you have the right to have
                incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.</li>
            <li>You have the right to request from us the erasure of personal data concerning you without undue delay,
                and we shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following
                grounds applies: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they
                were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw your consent on which the processing is based
                according to point (a) of Article 6(1), or point (a) of Article 9(2) GDPR, and where there is no other
                legal ground for the processing; you object to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) GDPR and there
                are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or you object to the processing pursuant to
                Article 21(2) GDPR; the personal data have been unlawfully processed; the personal data have to be
                erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which we are subject; the
                personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to
                in Article 8(1) GDPR. Where we have made personal data public and are obliged pursuant to Article 17(1)
                GDPR to erase the personal data, we, taking account of available technology and the cost of
                implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers which
                are processing the personal data that you have requested the erasure by such controllers of any links
                to, or copy or replication of, those personal data. The right to erasure ("right to be forgotten") does
                not exist insofar as the processing is necessary for exercising the right to freedom of expression and
                information; for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State
                law to which we are subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in
                the exercise of official authority vested in us; for reasons of public interest in the area of public
                health in accordance with points (h) and (i) of Article 9(2) as well as Article 9(3) GDPR; for archiving
                purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes in
                accordance with Article 89(1) GDPR, insofar as the right referred to in section a) is likely to render
                impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing; or for the
                establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</li>
            <li>You have the right to request the restriction of processing of your personal data where one of the
                following applies: the accuracy of the personal data is contested by you, for a period enabling us to
                verify the accuracy of the personal data; the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of the
                personal data and request the restriction of their use instead; we no longer need the personal data for
                the purposes of the processing, but they are required by you for the establishment, exercise, or defense
                of legal claims; you have objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) GDPR pending the verification
                whether our legitimate grounds override yours. Where processing has been restricted pursuant to the
                above, such personal data shall, with the exception of storage, only be processed with your consent or
                for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of
                another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the Union or of a Member
                State. If you have obtained restriction of processing pursuant to the above, you shall be informed by us
                before the restriction of processing is lifted.</li>
            <li>You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a
                structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to
                another controller without hindrance from us, where: the processing is based on consent pursuant to
                point (a) of Article 6(1) GDPR or point (a) of Article 9(2) GDPR or on a contract pursuant to point (b)
                of Article 6(1) GDPR; and the processing is carried out by automated means.</li>
            <li>You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to
                processing of personal data concerning you which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR,
                including profiling based on those provisions. We shall no longer process the personal data unless we
                demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights, and
                freedoms or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. If you object to processing for
                direct marketing purposes, the personal data shall no longer be processed for such purposes.</li>
            <li>You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to processing of
                personal data concerning you which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR, including
                profiling based on those provisions. We shall no longer process the personal data unless we demonstrate
                compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights, and freedoms or
                for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</li>
            <li>Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a
                complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence,
                place of work, or place of the alleged infringement if you consider that the processing of personal data
                relating to you infringes the GDPR. The supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged
                shall inform the complainant on the progress and the outcome of the complaint including the possibility
                of a judicial remedy pursuant to Article 78 GDPR.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Information about legal bases: The legal basis for the processing of personal data is, insofar as we obtain
            the consent of the data subject for processing operations for specific purposes, point (a) of Article 6(1)
            GDPR. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data
            subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of
            goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on point (b) of Article 6(1) GDPR. The same
            applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for
            example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a legal
            obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations,
            the processing is based on point (c) of Article 6(1) GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data
            may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. This would
            be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data,
            or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital, or other third party. Then the
            processing would be based on point (d) of Article 6(1) GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based
            on Article 6(1) GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the
            abovementioned legal grounds if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued
            by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or
            fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such
            processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the
            European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a
            client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).</p>
        <p>Processed data types: Inventory data (e.g., names, addresses), contact data (e.g., e-mail, telephone
            numbers), content data (e.g., text input, photographs, videos), usage data (e.g., websites visited, interest
            in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g., device information, IP addresses).</p>
        <p>Persons affected: Users (e.g., website visitors, users of online services).</p>
        <p>Purposes of processing: Contractual services and support, contact inquiries and communication, office and
            organizational procedures, management and response to inquiries.</p>
        <p>Legal Basis: Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a GDPR), Performance of a contract and pre-contractual
            inquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b. GDPR), Fulfillment of legal obligations (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. c.
            GDPR), Legitimate Interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f. GDPR).</p>
        <p>Categories of Recipients: Internal authorities and organizations, processors, payment service providers.</p>
        <p>Legal Basis: Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a GDPR), Legitimate Interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f
            GDPR).</p>
        <h2 id="m263">Definitions of Terms</h2>
        <p>This section provides an overview of the terms used in this privacy policy. Many of the terms are drawn from

                or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing
                of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member
                State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or
                Member State law.</li>

                another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public
                authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with
                Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those
                public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the
                purposes of the processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Third Party:</strong> "Third party" means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency,
                or body other than the data subject, controller, processor, and persons who, under the direct authority

            <li><strong>Consent:</strong> "Consent" of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed, and
                unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear
                affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="m258">Applicable Legal Bases</h2>
        <p>In accordance with Art. 13 GDPR, we inform you of the legal basis of our data processing. If the legal basis
            is not mentioned in the data protection declaration, the following applies: The legal basis for obtaining
            consent is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a and Art. 7 GDPR, the legal basis for processing for the performance of our
            services and performance of contractual measures as well as answering inquiries is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b
            GDPR, the legal basis for processing to fulfill our legal obligations is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR, and the
            legal basis for processing to safeguard our legitimate interests is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. In the event
            that the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal
            data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. d GDPR serves as the legal basis.</p>
        <h2 id="m255">Security Measures</h2>
        <p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking
            into account the state of the art, the implementation costs, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of
            processing, as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural
            persons, in order to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.</p>
        <p>The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by
            controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access to, input, transmission, security
            of availability, and their separation. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of
            data subject rights, the deletion of data, and the response to data threats. Furthermore, we take the
            protection of personal data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software, and
            processes, in accordance with the principle of data protection through technology design and data
            protection-friendly default settings (Art. 25 GDPR).</p>
